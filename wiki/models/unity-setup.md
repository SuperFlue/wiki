# Beat Saber custom models Unity prep guide

## Introduction
This guide is meant to be a unified guide for setting up your Unity project to create custom models in Beat Saber.

There is a bit split up information between the guides on how to prepare Unity so this is meant to be your one stop guide to get started.

## Unity Hub
So to start off it is highly reccomended to use Unity Hub to manage your Unity installs and projects.  
This will simplify things a lot.

Unity Hub can be downloaded from the [Unity download page](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) (click on "Download Unity Hub).

With Unity Hub installed you should be able to easily get the needed version of Unity though the [Unity Download achive](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive).  
And you should be able to also use the Unity version quick links to install the right version.

## Installing Unity
At the time of writing this the current Unity version of Beat Saber is ``2019.3.15f1`` and so it is highly reccomended to install this version when you want to prepare custom models for use in Beat Saber.

With Unity Hub you can copy this into you browser address bar to get the right version ``unityhub://2019.3.15f1/59ff3e03856d`` (because of limitations direcly embedding this link does not work).
